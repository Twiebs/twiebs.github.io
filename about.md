My name is Torin Wiebelt.  I am a 21 year old C++ programmer, also experienced in programming with Java, C# and Python.  I learned how to program when I was 12 years old out of a desire to mod games.  I was fascinated by an open source game called Tremulous based on the Quake3 Engine so i taught myself C.  I was able to make small tweaks to the game by studying the code and making small changes to see the outcome.  I didnt know what practialy any of the code did at the time but i managed to make small tweaks such as giving the aliens guns or making humans crawl on walls.  I retain a passion for Game Development to this day but my real love is programming itself.  I am really intrested in low-level programming and creating programs from stratch.  I focus mostly on Low Level Game Engine programing and am currently experimeneting with a compiler frontend impelementation for LLVM.  Please check out my [Projects](/projects/) page!
