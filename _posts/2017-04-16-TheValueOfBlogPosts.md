title: The Value of Blog Posts
category: all
---

I'm writing this post on April 16th, 2017, as I'm staring at a drafts folder
with partialy finished posts from over a year ago. 
I feel considerable amounts self-doubt, trepidation, and discouragment towards writing blog posts.
In programming, and anything else for that matter, there is no such thing as perfection. Software development is about 
choosing one tradeoff versues another based on metrics defined by the problem being 
solved and the prefrences of the team.  I feel like anything that I put out
into the world must have a high value content.  I constantly find myself
geting caught up evaluating the objetive value of a post and ultimatly
find myself concluding that it is usless and should not be published.

I incorrectly assumed that the only valuable thing that I could
write about would be programming. The blog posts that I have the found the most valueable
are usualy about other peoples expereiences rather than techinal posts.
Software is made by human beings, and talking openly and honestly about humman issues is a valueable discussion to engage in. 

While I was trying to write a blog post, getting discouraged about value,
and ultimatly giving up, I realized that I could just write about exactly what I was feeling.
I think most people must feel this way to some degree.  Hopefully its
not to the extent that I experience, but if you do, I hope that you
have found this blog post valuable in some way.
