</h1><p>One of the important features that I wanted when creating this new iteration of my game engine
Was</p><p>the ablity to hotload code while the engine is still running.  I wanted this system to be as maximaly flexiable
as</p><p>possible.  I really wanted to be able to hotload code that contained OpenGL functions.  This is how i accomplished
OpenGL</p><p>function hotloading in the Venom game engine.
</p><h1>C Preprocessor Metaprograming
</h1><p>The problem is that when the dll containing the game code is realoaded after compilation functions that
exist</p><p>in the engine's executable will not be avaible to it.  OpenGL functions are loaded in the engine
using</p><p>the same system that the game code uses to obtain them.
</p><p>The opengl procedures are defined in the file opengl_procedures.h
This</p><p>is a small example of what that file looks like
</p><ul><li>This is a test list to see what happens when i add it
</li><li>This could potential fuck it up tremendously
