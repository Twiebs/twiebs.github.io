> ###LLVM Toy Language
I have been working on an experimental toy language compiler frontend that targets llvm.  The language is not designed for writing real software, it is for experimental purposes only.  

>####Noteable Features:

>- Multi-threaded compilation
- No header files.  Dependices are resolved after the AST has been fully parsed.
- Overloadable functions at global scope or locally within a another function
