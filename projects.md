The system becomes incredibly flexible and powerfull when used with compositing functions together
to generate webpages.  This data driven interface allows html generation based on any arbitrary data source.

### Features
- Data driven immediate mode interface
- Standard HTML tag generation 
- Incremental Markdown parser 
	- Custom markdown procedure call syntax
- C/C++ syntax highlighting

You can check out an example of how this tool is used by taking a look at the source code used for this
