</h1><p>A year ago I started writing a 3D game engine.  Today I started writing a new 3D game engine from scratch using none of the code from the previous incardination.
This</p><p>is because the original engine which I had dubbed "Raptor" was written to be very modular and generic.
The</p><p>problem: too much effort was expended on organizing the code rather than solving the difficult technical problems involved with 3D game engine programming.
Another</p><p>issue with the initial engine was that there was no defined goal of what exactly I wanted to achieve with the project.
At</p><p>one point I had written a level editor without any intent to use it just though that it would be cool.
</p><h1>What was wrong
</h1><ul><li>templates slowed down compile times
</li><li>focused on design rather than solving problems
</li><li>tried to be very generic rather than attack specific problems directly
</li></ul></div><div class="seperator"></div></body></html>
