This allows any arbitrarydata source to be used in the HTML generation phase.  Requiring a plethora of external tools to generate html markup.  By providing a low level data drivennative interface for webpage generation, web content can be produced from any arbitrary data source ina very flexible manner.  The native c interface induces more verbosity upfront but provides maximalflexibility and customization power.</p></div><div class="content"><div class="post-header"><a href="2016-01-22.html"><h1>Hotloading OpenGL Procedures with C preprocessor metaprograming</h1></a><h3>22 January, 2016</h3></div><p>One of the important features that I wanted when creating this new iteration of my game engineWas the ablity to hotload code while the engine is still running.  I wanted this system to be as maximaly flexiableas possible.  I really wanted to be able to hotload code that contained OpenGL functions.  This is how i accomplishedOpenGL function hotloading in the Venom game engine.</p></div><div class="content"><div class="post-header"><a href="2016-01-08.html"><h1>Writing a new Game Engine</h1></a><h3>08 January, 2016</h3></div><p>A year ago I started writing a 3D game engine.  Today I started writing a new 3D game engine from scratch using none of the code from the previous incardination.This is because the original engine which I had dubbed "Raptor" was written to be very modular and generic.The problem: too much effort was expended on organizing the code rather than solving the difficult technical problems involved with 3D game engine programming.Another issue with the initial engine was that there was no defined goal of what exactly I wanted to achieve with the project.At one point I had written a level editor without any intent to use it just though that it would be cool.</p></div></body></html>
