</h1><p>This site originialy used jekyll to generate a static site from markdown files; 
however</p><p>, jekyll requires a large quantity of dependiecens and doesn't offer the flexibility I was looking for.
I</p><p>decided to replace jekyll with a custom built tool for generating HTML within C++.  This allows any arbitrary
data</p><p>source to be used in the HTML generation phase.

</h1><p>One of the important features that I wanted when creating this new iteration of my game engine
Was</p><p>the ablity to hotload code while the engine is still running.  I wanted this system to be as maximaly flexiable
as</p><p>possible.  I really wanted to be able to hotload code that contained OpenGL functions.  This is how i accomplished
OpenGL</p><p>function hotloading in the Venom game engine.
</p><h1>C Preprocessor Metaprograming
</h1><p>The problem is that when the dll containing the game code is realoaded after compilation functions that
exist</p><p>in the engine's executable will not be avaible to it.  OpenGL functions are loaded in the engine
using</p><p>the same system that the game code uses to obtain them.
</p><p>The opengl procedures are defined in the file opengl_procedures.h
This</p><p>is a small example of what that file looks like
</p><ul><li>This is a test list to see what happens when i add it
</li><li>This could potential fuck it up tremendously

</h1><p>A year ago I started writing a 3D game engine.  Today I started writing a new 3D game engine from scratch using none of the code from the previous incardination.
This</p><p>is because the original engine which I had dubbed "Raptor" was written to be very modular and generic.
The</p><p>problem: too much effort was expended on organizing the code rather than solving the difficult technical problems involved with 3D game engine programming.
Another</p><p>issue with the initial engine was that there was no defined goal of what exactly I wanted to achieve with the project.
At</p><p>one point I had written a level editor without any intent to use it just though that it would be cool.
</p><h1>What was wrong
</h1><ul><li>templates slowed down compile times
</li><li>focused on design rather than solving problems
</li><li>tried to be very generic rather than attack specific problems directly
