My name is Torin Wiebelt.  I am a self taught 21 year old C/C++ programmer, also experienced in programming with Java, C#, Python and x86 assembly.
I learned the C Programming language when i was 12 years old by studying an open source game based on the Quake3 Engine and reading various resources on the internet.  


I retain a passion for Game Development to this day but my real love is programming itself.  

I am really interested in low-level programming and creating things from scratch.  I maintain a strong passion for creating games today, but my intrest has shifted to programing language and operating system design.    

> **What I am currently working on:**

> - Raptor Game Framework and Engine
> - Experimental compiled language (LLVM backend)
> - TJW-OS: x86 Operating System
