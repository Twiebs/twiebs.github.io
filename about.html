I am a self taught 21 year old C/C++ programmer, also experienced in programming with Java, C#, Python and x86 assembly.
I learned the C Programming language when i was 12 years old by studying an open source game based on the Quake3 Engine and reading various resources on the internet.
I retain a passion for Game Development to this day but my real love is programming itself.
I am really interested in low-level programming and creating things from scratch.
I maintain a strong passion for creating games today, but my intrest has shifted to programing language and operating system design.

</p><ul><li>Raptor Game Framework and Engine
</li><li>Experimental compiled language (LLVM backend)
</li><li>TJW-OS: x86 Operating System
