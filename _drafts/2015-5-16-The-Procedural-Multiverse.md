title: Procedural Multiverse (Part 1) - Inhabited
---
This is my [Forever Project](http://jwb.io/20130122-the-joys-of-having-a-forever-project.html).  Its a "game" (with no gameplay... more like a simulation) that is set the multi-verse. Most procedural universe generators are misnomers.  They procedurally generate content within our universe, not a universe itself.  With this project i plan on generating a "multi-verse" each universe having their own laws of physics.

## Inhabited: Origins
I started working on a 2D version of a solar system generator by accident while developing a top down shoot called Inhabited.  

The project was supposed to be a simple mobile twin stick shooter but it quickly escalated and i gave up trying to actually make a shippable app and focused soley on generating procedural content.  The generator used the diamond square algorithim and OpenSimpelexNoise to generate a heightmap using points inside a circle.  Intervals of the heightmap were assigned a color value.
