title: A Life of Learning

Being a programmer is commiting to a life of learning.  As new technologies
are introduced, new aproaches realized, codepbases familiarized we have
to adapt to an ever changing landscape.  Even with just that invovled There
are more domains to program in than anyone could ever hope to master.
There is so much to be learned and a limmited time to learn it.
We rightly prioritize working on the projects we are involved with.
There are bountiful opertunitines to learn while working on a project,
but often we find ourselves working within the mold defined by the problems
we solve.  This is excelent to culivate expertiese, but is not condusive
to expanding the scope of knowledge and improving our fundamental skill.
That is why I have commited myself to practicing programming everyday.
Anytime I find a topic intresting I will write it down for further exploration
during a practice session.  I also use this time to conduct research into
areas that I am intrested in.

I wanted to share what I have found useful when 
I wrote a simple tool to keep track of what I work on everyday.  The tool
is used to schedule things and stuff.

I usualy spend less than 30 minutes a day practicing, but the value of
the excerise is much more valuable.  Learning somthing new about programing
everyday is constantly improving your abilities and redefining the scope
and context in which problems are solved.  

I have noticed that when I practice implementing a particular algorithim
or researching an area that I am not familar with, I don't retain it after
years from not looking at it without repitiion.  I was moving from topic
to topic in my daily practice as I started to feel comfortable with it, but
after coming back to it after over a year I don't recall as much as I would
like.  Thats why I realized that it is important to review what you have
learned.  

Looking in my practice folder, the first file I'm seeing is called 2015-12-21.cpp
